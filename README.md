# minecraft-react

I more or less followed the tutorial made by Daniel Bark on youtube. I am not going to take credit for the starting but I am going to add stuff on my own.

!! I am open to any suggestions or bug fixes or additional fixes you might like to add to it. Open in issues.

# Change Log:

- Version 0.1.24 Alpha

1. Add Legend.
2. Add Game Version.
3. Add 2 New Cubes (Stripped Log, Cobblestone).
4. Change ground from grass to Bedrock.
5. Reduce player size (Before the player wasn't able to squeeze in one block surrounded by other blocks, now they can).
6. Fix player repeatedly jumping when spacebar is held.

8. Increase ground area from 100x100 to 200x200.
