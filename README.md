# minecraft-react
I more or less followed the tutorial made by Daniel Bark on youtube. I am not going to take credit for the starting but I am going to add stuff on my own.

# Change Log:

- Version 0.1.24 Alpha
1. Add Legend.
2. Add Game Version.
3. Add 2 New Cubes (Stripped Log, Cobblestone).
4. Change ground from grass to Bedrock.
5. Reduce player size (Before the player wasn't able to squeeze in one block surrounded by other blocks, now they can).
